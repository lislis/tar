### Run it yourself

You need a Launchpad mini as controller (another may work, too, but that's the one I used during development).
Clone this and start a HTTP server in the root. Open in Chrome or another browser that speaks WebMidi.

Enjoy!

### Thanks

To all the people who made Global Game Jam 2018 happen. It is a lot of fun.
To all the people who work on a-frame. It is amazing.
